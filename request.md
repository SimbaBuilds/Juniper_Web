I am implementing a public blog page for the site. Please:
- App a "blog" public route on the same level as the integration-descriptions route
- Add it the public header
- Add basic functionality for the list view page and the single post view page
    - Single post view page should allow for comments
- Decide on database table schema 
- Implement all of the above
- Write a SQL migration script to a markdown file for me to use
