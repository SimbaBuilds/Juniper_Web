It is currently September 2025.
In the Epic MyChart project creation UI, I had to specify smartv1 or smartv2 -- I chose Smart v2 because smart v1 is apparently being phased out.  I also chose R4 since it is newer.  

Note in console:
“SMART v2 is supported starting in Epic version Nov 2024. Customers on prior versions may run into issues depending on how scopes are used for this app.”


Please continue researching these topics, provide me with options, and give a recommendation.
