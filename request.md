We setting up contact forms with Google SMTP by copying an implementation from another project.
Current implementation is in /Users/cameronhightower/Software_Projects/juniper_web/sheet_assist_frontend_ref  in files specified in /Users/cameronhightower/Software_Projects/juniper_web/cursor_locate_contact_form_and_email_lo.md

Please:
1. Copy email logic and implement component keeping style consistent with current project.  Implement component in the following places:
a. The support page
b. A section at the bottom of the public landing page: "Want something like Juniper for your business?  Please fill out this contact form"

Let me know what env vars I need to set.
