We need to update the manual data entry UI with the new metrics as well.  We need similar metrics selection instead of standing fields.

I;d also like the summary metrics selection values to be categorized like the trends chart values.

Maybe we could standardize this across all 3 metrics selection UIs ( manual entry, summary, and trends)
